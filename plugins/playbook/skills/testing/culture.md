# Testing Culture Worth Transmitting

Read this after freezing the project's specification, human-signal, and
architecture-risk ledgers. Use it as accumulated cross-project experience:
challenge omissions, recognize recurring failure shapes, and reuse proven habits.
Do not treat it as a source of project requirements. Pair every borrowed lesson
with local evidence and an applicability check.

## What tests are for

Tests mediate among human intent, coding agents, code, and the external world. At
their best they provide:

- **executable memory:** preserve *why* a failure mattered after the original
  conversation is gone;
- **delegated perception:** let an agent observe consequences it would otherwise
  ask a human to inspect;
- **attention compression:** pay the diagnosis cost once instead of making the
  human relive it;
- **bounded autonomy:** let agents move independently only as far as the evidence
  honestly supports.

A green suite is not the culture. The culture is the habit of turning promises,
lived corrections, and foreseeable risks into trustworthy feedback.

## Practices worth transmitting

### Preserve the betrayal, not only the fix

Keep the smallest realistic input, topology, trace, timing condition, or
interaction that produced lost trust. Name the user-visible failure. An abstract
test that erases the incident may preserve implementation behavior while losing
the reason for the test.

### Assert forbidden effects

Do not stop at the returned error or warning. Assert that the dangerous call,
write, retry, disclosure, duplicate message, or state transition did **not**
occur. For safety and preservation, test the world *after* rejection.

### Prove claims at the owning production boundary

Ask which layer owns the risky assumption and use the lowest boundary capable of
disproving it. A mock cannot establish browser, provider, OS, Git, or database
truth. Conversely, do not pay for end-to-end tests when a pure policy owns the
rule.

Check for shadow paths: test-only adapters, reimplemented logic, code-derived
fixtures, different thresholds, or entry points production never uses can create
realistic-looking false confidence.

### Separate observation from authority

Telemetry should often survive observer failure. Enforcement must fail closed
*before* the risky action. Do not give loggers, advisors, vetoes, and executors
one undifferentiated failure contract. Test the consequence appropriate to the
component's authority.

### Model lifecycle, identity, and interruption

Steady-state examples miss many expensive failures. Exercise start, retry,
cancellation, restart, handoff, expiry, and concurrent transitions. Carry stable
identities and provenance through aggregation; equal values or plausible counts
do not prove that the correct entities were used.

For persistence, migration, release, and archive work, inject failure between
steps. Require recovery to preserve the prior valid state. When nonempty durable
state is unreadable, refusing "helpful recovery" may be safer than overwriting the
only evidence.

### Keep confidence states honest and current

Distinguish:

- narrative memory;
- executable-open fixtures, skips, or xfails;
- controlled regressions;
- owner-boundary proof;
- historical campaigns;
- current live canaries;
- manual or human-owned judgment.

Evidence decays. A stale test map, untracked regression, excluded test-shaped
file, silent optional probe, or vestigial test must not inherit current
confidence. Retire obsolete tests deliberately when the protected behavior is
deliberately retired.

### Calibrate consequential tests

For an important regression, temporarily introduce the named defect, require the
test to fail for the intended reason, and revert the mutation. This checks whether
the executable observer can actually see its claimed betrayal. Use targeted
calibration, not mutation-score accumulation.

### Keep semantic claims semantic

Schema validity, enum membership, vector shape, and numeric bounds do not prove
usefulness, coherence, or meaning. Layer mechanical checks with named positives
and hard negatives, metamorphic cases, frozen provenance, and small blinded or
human evaluation when judgment owns the final claim.

### Make failure useful to the next agent

A test should identify the violated invariant and the likely owning layer without
exposing private details or requiring the human to reconstruct the story. Separate
product, environment, protocol, and test-harness failure before weakening a
contract.

## Reuse protocol

For each cultural lesson that appears relevant:

1. Cite the local specification, human signal, or architecture evidence that makes
   it applicable.
2. State the failure it would prevent and the boundary that owns it.
3. Choose the cheapest proof that would materially improve confidence.
4. Record limits, flakiness, credentials, semantic judgment, and maintenance cost.
5. Mark the lesson `ADOPT`, `PARK`, or `REJECT` for this project with a reason.

Independent local discovery comes first. Shared culture is a prior and a challenge
set, not a substitute for listening to the current project or human.

## Habits worth retiring

- Equating test count, green status, or coverage percentage with user confidence.
- Asserting a warning without checking preservation or forbidden side effects.
- Presenting mock-owned behavior as external-platform truth.
- Treating historical/manual evidence as an active regression lane.
- Letting xfails preserve an indefinitely worsening failure envelope.
- Mistaking generated summaries or prompts for direct human intent.
- Assuming a file runs because its name looks like a test.
- Deriving tests only from module layout, only from specifications, or only from
  expressed pain.
- Automating irreducibly human judgment with a convenient false oracle.
- Importing a cross-project lesson without demonstrating local applicability.

The cultural objective is not more testing. It is enough durable, well-placed
evidence that future agents can work with greater independence without
disconnecting from human experience or making the human pay for the same lesson
again.
