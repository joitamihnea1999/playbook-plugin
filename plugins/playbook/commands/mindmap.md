Generate a populated `MIND_MAP.md` for this project. Work directly — no Task agents — so the user can steer between steps.

## Process

1. **Scan codebase:** Read READMEs, configs, entry points. Map directories, tech stack, architecture, data flow.
2. **Mine git history for the *why*:** how the architecture got its shape and what design decisions it reveals — fold the reasons into subsystem nodes. The *when* (hashes, dates) stays in git; it does not go in the map.
3. **Construct map:** Plan node hierarchy, write nodes, weave links. Use the format from the `mindmap.md` skill.
4. **Write to `MIND_MAP.md`** in the project root. If one exists, replace scaffold content but preserve any existing populated nodes.

## Key Rules

- Each node must be a **single line** (grep-friendly)
- Target **20-50 nodes** with cross-links
- Routing nodes [1-5] link to everything else
- Links embedded naturally in text, not clustered at end
- Capture design *decisions and their reasons* — never commit hashes, dates, or a history node (git holds the *when*)
- Reference actual file paths, function names, numbers
