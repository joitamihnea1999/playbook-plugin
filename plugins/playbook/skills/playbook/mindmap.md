# Mind Map — Format Reference

A mind map is a **read/write memory** for AI agents — a knowledge graph that speeds up bootstrapping and carries context across sessions. This is not a log. Nodes are living documents that evolve as understanding deepens.

## What belongs (and what doesn't)

The map answers **"how does this work, and where is it?"** — never **"what happened, and when?"**. It is loaded into context to orient an agent, so every line is resident cost: keep the signal, push the log elsewhere.

- **Belongs:** the current shape — subsystems, data flow, boundaries, key files/functions, and the *why* behind a design that isn't obvious from the code.
- **Does NOT belong:** commit hashes, dates, changelog entries, "added in v2.0" timelines, a "Development History" node. Git already holds the *when*; worklogs hold the narrative. A node that reads like a diff or a release note is log noise that bloats every session — cut it, or keep only the *decision* it taught ("chose JSON over SQLite for hand-editability"), never the timestamp. Bootstrap loads this map every session; the audit's `mindmap-node-freshness` check flags nodes whose cited code has moved on — so stale prose is a liability, not a keepsake.

## Node Format

**Each node must be a single line** — no line breaks within a node. This makes grep trivial: `grep "^\[5\]" MIND_MAP.md` returns the entire node.

```
[N] **Title** - Text with [link-nr] embedded naturally. Dense but readable, 150-400 words per node. Every sentence adds information. All on one line, no matter how long.
```

Every `MIND_MAP.md` starts with this header:

```markdown
> **For AI Agents:** This mind map is your primary knowledge index. Read overview nodes [1-5] first, then follow links [N] to find what you need. Always reference node IDs. When you make changes, update outdated nodes immediately — especially overview nodes. Add new nodes only for genuinely new concepts. Keep it compact (20-50 nodes typical). The mind map wraps every task: consult it, rely on it, update it.
```

## Routing Nodes [1-5]

The first 5 nodes are **routing hubs** — they point to everything else and get updated frequently:

- [1] **Overview** — what this is, main entry point, links to all major concepts
- [2-5] **Major themes** — each covers a domain, links to relevant detail nodes

**Routing nodes change as the map grows.** When you add node [47] about authentication, go back and add `[47]` to the relevant routing node.

## Node Hierarchy

| Level | Nodes | Content |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Foundation | 1-5 | Overview, core theory, data flow, major architectural layers |
| Systems | 6-15 | Major subsystems, key features, components |
| Implementation | 16-20 | Tech stack, history, workflow, roadmap, principles |
| Deep dives | 21+ | Algorithms, optimization, error handling, performance |

**Scale:** Simple topics 15-30 nodes. Standard projects 30-60. Complex systems 60-150. Large codebases 150+ (routing nodes become critical).

## Link Principles

Links `[N]` flow naturally in sentences, not listed at the end:
- Good: "The storage layer [6] handles persistence"
- Bad: "The storage layer handles persistence [6][7][8][12]"

Every node links to 2-3+ others; important nodes link to 5-10. Bidirectional: if [5] mentions [12], [12] should mention [5]. Link every 1-2 sentences, not every clause.

**Density targets:**
- Overview nodes: 5-10 links
- System nodes: 3-7 links
- Implementation nodes: 2-5 links
- Specialized nodes: 2-4 links

## Writing Style

- Use specific names: "The PCAVisualizer class in pcaVisualizer.ts" not "the visualizer"
- Include numbers: "5-10 features", "23,000+ lines"
- **Cite the files the node owns.** A system/implementation node should name its actual path(s) — `src/store.py`, `tasks/mindmap.py`. This is not just precision: those citations are the node's *anchor*, so `tasks audit` can tell you when the node has drifted from the code (the `mindmap-node-freshness` check), and `recall` lands you on the right node. A node that owns code but cites no path can't be checked for staleness.
- Explain WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT exists
- **Add a keyword alias when the search terms differ from the title.** If people would look for a node by a word its title doesn't contain, put `<!-- keywords: login, credentials, sso -->` on it so `recall` finds it by meaning (see Retrieval).
- When information changes, update existing nodes — don't create duplicates
- **Well-formedness is checked mechanically** — `tasks audit` flags duplicate ids, a node with no `**Title**`, and any node nothing links to (dead memory). Every node earns its place by being reachable: give a new node at least one incoming link from the subsystem it belongs under.

## Examples

### Good — Single-Line Nodes, Natural Linking

```
[1] **Project Overview** - TaskFlow is a command-line task manager built in Python that emphasizes keyboard-driven workflows. The core architecture separates task storage [6] from the rendering layer [7], allowing multiple output formats without touching business logic. Users interact primarily through vim-style keybindings [12] which were chosen over menus for speed. The data model [3] uses a flat JSON structure rather than nested categories because real-world task hierarchies rarely go deeper than two levels. Integration with external calendars [9] was added in v2.0 after user feedback showed most people needed deadline sync.

[6] **Storage Layer** - The StorageManager class in storage.py handles all persistence operations [1][3]. It maintains an in-memory cache that syncs to disk on every write, which is acceptable for typical task volumes (under 10,000 items). The JSON file format was chosen over SQLite for portability and easy manual editing. Backup rotation keeps the last 5 versions automatically.
```

### Bad — Links Clustered at End

```
[1] **Project Overview** - TaskFlow is a command-line task manager... Integration was added in v2.0. [3][6][7][9][12]
```

### Bad — Over-Linked

```
[1] **Project Overview** - TaskFlow [2] is a command-line [4] task manager [3] built in Python [5] that emphasizes keyboard-driven [12] workflows [7].
```

## Node Templates

**System node:**
```
[N] **System Name** - Brief definition and purpose [parent-node]. The system consists of COMPONENT1 which handles TASK1 [detail-node], COMPONENT2 for TASK2 [detail-node]. Implementation resides in path/to/files using TECHNOLOGY [tech-node]. Integrates with EXTERNAL_SYSTEM [integration-node] through API_METHOD. Key parameters include PARAM1 (range, default) and PARAM2 (type, purpose) [parameter-node].
```

**No history node.** Resist the urge to add a "Development History" node full of commit hashes and dates — that is a log, and it bloats the resident map for information git already holds. When the *evolution* of a subsystem carries a design lesson, fold that lesson (the decision and its reason, not the hash) into the owning subsystem node: "Storage moved from SQLite to flat JSON so tasks stay hand-editable" — not "commit a1b2c3d (2024-03) switched to JSON".

## Retrieval — `tasks recall` (preferred) and grep

`tasks recall` is the sharpest way in, because it spans both tiers and ranks by relevance:

```bash
tasks recall 5             # node 5 in FULL — from MIND_MAP.md AND MIND_MAP_OVERFLOW.md
tasks recall auth policy   # ranked relevance search (BM25 + plural stemming), best node first
```

Plain grep still works on the single-line format:

```bash
grep "^\[5\]" MIND_MAP.md         # Returns entire node 5 (one line)
grep "\[5\]" MIND_MAP.md          # All lines referencing node 5
```

**Keyword aliases (optional):** a node can declare synonyms its prose doesn't spell out, so a search finds it by *meaning*, not just wording. Put `<!-- keywords: login, credentials, sso -->` on any line of the node; `tasks recall` weights those terms heavily. Use this for a node whose common search terms differ from its title (an "Identity" node people look for as "auth"/"login").

## Quality Checklist

- All major systems/features have nodes
- Every significant file/component is mentioned
- Design *decisions* and their reasons captured — but no commit hashes, dates, or a history node (git holds the *when*)
- Every node has 2+ links, important nodes 5+
- Links embedded naturally in text, bidirectional where appropriate
- Each node has a clear title, first sentence defines the concept
- Actual file/function names used, not generic descriptions
- Each node is a single line (grep-friendly)
